## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## MCP Rules Server Integration

When working with the `rulekit-mcp` MCP server, use the `get_mcp_instructions` tool to get detailed usage instructions.
